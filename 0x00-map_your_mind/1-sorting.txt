1.	input k numbers.

2.	initialize itration paramters I and j as  i = 0, j=1 and define variable temp

3.	start comparing the ith term with i+1 th term if greater exchanage thier position by temp = ni; ni= ni+1 ; then ni+1 = temp else keep them as they are. 

4.	repeat the operation 3 until the last number; that is i = j;

5.	incrment j by one and I =0. 

6.	repeat operation 3, 4 and 5 until j=k
